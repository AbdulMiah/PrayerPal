Within the time frame given, I was able to meet almost all my initial goals, and the features work as intended. I was able to follow and implement the wireframe design I created throughout the application’s planning phase. Whenever something went wrong, I was able to quickly refer to the course material, as well as using the Android Documentation and online resources to solve problems.

One thing I would do differently next time, though, is switching from using ListView to RecyclerView as it’s more powerful and flexible. Even in the intro of ListView’s in the Android Developer Documentation (2022), “For a more modern, flexible, and performant approach to displaying lists, use RecyclerView”. Although ListView’s are easier to use, RecyclerView’s has more functionality and control over the data set inside the adapter.

If I had more time, I’d want to make the application more responsive so it can adapt to different sized devices. I'd also include a ‘favourites’ feature to the Dua page that allows users to bookmark their favourite supplications. Other features I would like to add are:

- A one-time popup on first launch of the App that explains all features and how the app works
- Analytics for the tracker
- A fasting tracker
- Split the supplications into categories
