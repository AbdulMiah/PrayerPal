My objective is to develop a practical Islamic prayer application for Muslims. Prayer is one of the most essential pillars of Islam, so I decided to design a useful Islamic prayer application that Muslimâ€™s could utilise. Muslims are obligated to worship five times a day, and these prayers must be completed at certain times. As a result, having an application that displays all the prayer times would be beneficial to Muslims and will assist them in keeping track of their prayers. This application will contain numerous features such as a page where users can find invocations (Duas) to add to their prayers, as well as other handy features that will assist Muslims in improving their worship.
