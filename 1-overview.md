My objective is to develop a practical Islamic prayer application for Muslims. Prayer is one of the most essential pillars of Islam, so I decided to design a useful Islamic prayer application that Muslim’s could utilise. Muslims are obligated to worship five times a day, and these prayers must be completed at certain times. One of the ways Muslims determine when to pray is by using a physical copy of a prayer timetable obtained from their local mosque. As a result, having a digitally displayed prayer schedule would be advantageous since Muslims could access it from anywhere and it will assist them in keeping track of their prayers. This application will contain numerous features, such as, the ability to use a map to search for prayer times in different locations around the world, a compass that the user can use to find the direction of which they need to pray, a tracker where the user can check off the prayers they have completed throughout the day, and finally a page where users can find a list of supplications (Dua’s) to add to their prayers. In addition, a notification system to notify users when it’s time for the next prayer.
